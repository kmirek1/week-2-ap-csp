print(" Welcome to the Python Review Activity!")
print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Karissa Mirek"
age = 16
favorite_color = "Blue"
favorite_number = 5

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print("Uppercase:",first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print("Length of name:", len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print("My name is " + first_name + " and my favorite color is " + favorite_color)

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
add_result = 7 + 5
print("Addition (7 + 5):", add_result)

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
name = input("What is your name?:")
age = input("What is your age?:")
print("Your name is " + name + " and you are " + age +" years old.")

# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together

add_result = 7 + 5
print("Addition (7 + 5):", add_result)
